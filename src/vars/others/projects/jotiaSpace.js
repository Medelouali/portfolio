        The first time I started writing code I have listened to alot of advices from different 
        people but, to be honest and cut off the crap, the original idea I'll never get red off is 
        this: 'Working on real projects is the best way to master I have learned'. So the thing is 
        even though the idea of the project is not original, it's still worth it to put my skills 
        in it. The idea behind JotiaSpace is to sell used products unlike the new ones, instead of 
        getting red of them, we can get some dollars out of them. To be honest, in this project I 
        have learned alot of stuff like working with APIs, building one, working on backend, 
        connecting front-end to the backend, working on the database, besically the playing around 
        with the whole stack.
