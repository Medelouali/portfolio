    description: `
        In this project, I demonstrate my ability to design algorithms to solve specific tasks, 
        for example, I have combined recursion and Jsx. One of the most used powerful comcepts in 
        this project is recursion, it's used almost everywhere, and with the power of regular 
        expressions, strings got really friendly. The idea behind Enigma is similar to Matlab, 
        it's simply a linear interpreter with certain flexibility, I have tried to make it close 
        to the way we write code in variaty of programming languages. First I thought about this 
        project I had one goal in my mind is to test my javascript skills with some math concepts
        I learned along the way.
