    description: `Enigma is a cipher device developed and used in the early- to mid-20th century to protect commercial, diplomatic, and military communication. That's the formel answer if you are asking what the hell is Enigma anyway? But here we've developped a an Enigma Interpreter and we called such a thing because of the amount of math it's built on and it's use simplicity. Generally, when we talk about math we often link it up to complexity, well that's where Enigma comes in, it's just the right tool to bypass this misleading view. In this documentation, we try to keep it sample by explainning in great details each concept and ensuring that you know how to use it in your field using examples. While using Enigma Interpreter just keep in mind this: "We have built Enigma because we are problem solvers so please use this tool to solve problems" `,
